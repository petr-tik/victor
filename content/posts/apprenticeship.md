As an immigrant I feel obliged to help British youngsters secure great employment prospects. 

I was lucky to find myself in a supportive family that gave me the opportunity to move abroad and complete my education in Britain. Since growing up here, I feel proud to call this country my home now. 


It's still hard for immigrants to pass interviews, go through the legal and administrative hurdles to move to new country and make themselves productive. They should be celebrated. 

However, there are second-order effects of employers hiring increasingly more immigrants. They streamline the business workflows and start budgeting for even more hires from abroad. Their contribution to training and education becomes less immediately useful. After a while, the business people making budgeting decisions will have to decide between the costs of hiring immediately skilful immigrants against the long-term costs of investing in the local education system.
