Why don't Google change their hiring process? Aren't they missing out on loads of qualifying candidates?

As long as Google stock is going to rise in price (heads up that's not going to be forever), people will keep applying to Google. Therefore, the supply of candidates will be orders of magnitude greater than demand. Google is shooting fish in a barrel and more fish show up every second and ask for their permission to get shot.
